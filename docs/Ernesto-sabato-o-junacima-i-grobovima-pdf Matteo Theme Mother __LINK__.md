One of the main themes of the novel is motherhood and its influence on the characters' lives. Sabato explores how the lack of maternal love, or its excess, can lead to psychological disorders, such as schizophrenia, paranoia, or depression. He also shows how mothers can be sources of inspiration or repression for their children, especially for their artistic or intellectual aspirations.
 
Alejandra's mother, for example, is a dominant figure who controls her daughter's every move. She is obsessed with preserving the family's reputation and legacy, which has been tainted by scandals and madness. She forbids Alejandra from seeing Martin, whom she considers a bad influence. She also tries to prevent her from discovering the secrets of her grandfather, who was a famous general and a hero of the Argentine civil wars. Alejandra's mother represents the conservative and authoritarian values of the Argentine society of the time.
 
Martin's mother, on the other hand, is a passive and submissive woman who has abandoned her son to his father's care. She suffers from depression and lives in a state of apathy and indifference. She has no interest in Martin's feelings or dreams. She only visits him occasionally and gives him money or gifts. Martin's mother represents the emotional emptiness and alienation of the modern world.
 
Both mothers fail to provide their children with the love and support they need. As a result, Alejandra and Martin develop mental illnesses that isolate them from reality and drive them to despair. Alejandra suffers from schizophrenia and believes that she is haunted by evil forces that want to destroy her. She also inherits her grandfather's obsession with fire and death. Martin suffers from paranoia and believes that he is persecuted by a secret society of blind people who want to kill him. He also inherits his father's obsession with literature and philosophy.
 
The only positive maternal figure in the novel is Bruno's mother, who is Martin's friend and mentor. She is a kind and wise woman who encourages Martin to pursue his artistic vocation. She also helps him cope with his troubles and gives him hope for the future. Bruno's mother represents the humanistic and progressive values of the Argentine culture.
