Urdu language and literature have a long and rich history that spans over a thousand years. The origins of Urdu can be traced back to the various dialects of northern India that were influenced by Persian, Arabic and Turkish languages brought by the Muslim invaders and rulers. The earliest form of Urdu is known as Rekhta, which means "mixed" or "scattered" in Persian. Rekhta was a poetic language that blended Persian and Hindustani words and expressions. It was mainly used by the Sufi poets and mystics who sought to convey their spiritual experiences and messages in a simple and accessible language.
 
The development of Urdu as a distinct literary language is attributed to the poet Amir Khusrau (1253-1325), who is considered to be the father of Urdu literature. He wrote both in Persian and Rekhta, and introduced many new genres and forms of poetry, such as qawwali, masnavi, qasida and ghazal. He also enriched the vocabulary of Urdu with many Persian and Arabic words and idioms. His influence can be seen in the works of later poets such as Mir Taqi Mir (1723-1810), Mirza Ghalib (1797-1869) and Allama Iqbal (1877-1938), who are regarded as the pillars of classical Urdu poetry.
 
Urdu literature also flourished in prose, especially in the genres of fiction, biography, history and criticism. The first Urdu novel is said to be Mirat-ul-Uroos (The Bride's Mirror) by Nazir Ahmad (1831-1912), which was published in 1869. It was a realistic and moralistic story of two sisters, one who follows the traditional values of Islam and the other who adopts the modern ways of the British. The novel was widely read and appreciated by both Muslims and Hindus. Other notable Urdu novelists include Deputy Nazir Ahmad (1836-1912), Ratan Nath Sarshar (1846-1902), Abdul Halim Sharar (1860-1926) and Premchand (1880-1936), who wrote both in Urdu and Hindi.
 
Urdu literature also reflects the political and social changes that took place in India during the colonial and post-colonial periods. The Urdu poets played an important role in the Indian independence movement, expressing their patriotic sentiments and aspirations for freedom. Some of the prominent poets of this period include Altaf Hussain Hali (1837-1914), Muhammad Iqbal (1877-1938), Josh Malihabadi (1898-1982) and Faiz Ahmed Faiz (1911-1984). After the partition of India in 1947, Urdu literature faced new challenges and opportunities in both India and Pakistan. In India, Urdu faced competition from Hindi as the national language, while in Pakistan, it became the official language despite being spoken by a minority of the population. Urdu literature also diversified into new genres and styles, such as modern poetry, short story, drama, satire, humor and journalism.
