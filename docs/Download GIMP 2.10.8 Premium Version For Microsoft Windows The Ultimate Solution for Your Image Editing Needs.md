## What's new in GIMP 2.10.8?
 
GIMP 2.10.8 is mostly the result of dozens of bug fixes and optimizations that enhance the stability and performance of the software. Some of the notable improvements are:
 
- Dynamic chunk size for image projections: This allows better responsiveness of GIMP on less powerful machines whereas processing would be faster on more powerful ones.
- Step gradient-segment blending mode: This creates a hard-edge transition between two adjacent color stops at the midpoint, allowing multi-color hard-edge gradient fills.
- CIE xyY color space support: This enables color readouts in the CIE xyY color space, which separates luminance information from chromaticity information.
- Improved Save dialog: This shows more prominently the features preventing backward compatibility (in case you wish to send images to someone using an older version of GIMP).
- Improved RawTherapee detection on Windows: This works in sync with the developers of RawTherapee, a very nice RAW processing software.
