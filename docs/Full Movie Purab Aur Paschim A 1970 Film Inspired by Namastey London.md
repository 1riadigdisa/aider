Purab Aur Pachhim (East and West) is a 1970 Hindi movie written, directed by and starring Manoj Kumar. It also features Ashok Kumar, Saira Banu, Pran, Prem Chopra and Vinod Khanna in supporting roles. The movie is about Bharat (Manoj Kumar), the son of a freedom fighter who goes to Britain for studies and faces the cultural differences between Indians and Westerners. He tries to instill a sense of pride and respect for Indian culture in the NRIs (Non-Resident Indians) who have adopted Western ways of living. He also falls in love with Preeti (Saira Banu), the daughter of an Indian businessman who is ashamed of his roots.
 
The movie is considered to be one of the important films of its time, as it reflects the social and political situation of India in the late 1960s and early 1970s. India had gained independence from British rule in 1947, but had also faced two wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971, as well as internal conflicts and challenges. The movie portrays the patriotic spirit of the Indians who fought for freedom and also criticizes the betrayal of some Indians who collaborated with the British. The movie also highlights the problems of brain drain, cultural assimilation and identity crisis among the Indians living abroad.

It also conveys a message of love, respect and unity among all Indians, regardless of their geographical location. The movie is available to watch online on YouTube[^1^] or Plex[^3^].
  
The movie also explores the theme of love and romance across cultural boundaries. Bharat and Preeti face many obstacles and opposition from their families and society, who do not approve of their relationship. Bharat tries to convince Preeti's father, Mr. Sharma (Madan Puri), that he is a worthy suitor for his daughter and that he respects Indian culture and values. Preeti also tries to overcome her initial prejudice and ignorance about India and learns to appreciate its beauty and heritage. She also faces the challenge of adapting to a different lifestyle and environment in India.
 
The movie also depicts the contrast between the urban and rural life in India. Bharat belongs to a village in Uttar Pradesh, where he lives with his mother (Kamini Kaushal) and sister (Bharti). He is respected and loved by the villagers, who regard him as their leader and protector. He also has a close bond with his guru (Ashok Kumar), who taught him the ideals of patriotism and sacrifice. On the other hand, Preeti comes from a wealthy and modern family in London, where she enjoys a luxurious and comfortable life. She is spoiled and pampered by her parents and friends, who indulge in parties, alcohol and drugs.
 
The movie also shows the impact of the freedom struggle on the lives of the Indians. Bharat's father (Krishan Dhawan) was a freedom fighter who was killed by Harnam (Pran), a traitor who collaborated with the British. Harnam was rewarded by the British and became a rich and influential man in London. He also married Kaushalya (Nirupa Roy), the widow of Bharat's father, and had a son, Omkar (Prem Chopra). Omkar grew up to be a spoiled and arrogant man, who despises India and its culture. He also tries to harm Bharat and Preeti, who expose his father's treachery.
