# What is RhinoResurf and how can it help you with reverse engineering?
 
RhinoResurf is a plug-in for RhinocerosÂ® 4.0 and 5.0 that allows you to reconstruct the geometry of an object from a mesh or point cloud that describes it. It can also create free-form NURBS surfaces from polygon meshes or curves. RhinoResurf is a useful tool for reverse engineering, metal forming design, 3D modeling and other applications that require NURBS modeling technologies.
 
RhinoResurf has many features that make it easy and powerful to use. Some of these features are:

- NURBS fitting with specified tolerance. You can control how closely the surface matches the input data.
- Controllable surface smoothness. You can adjust the level of smoothness of the surface by 5 levels.
- G1 continuity transition. The transition between any two NURBS surface patches reaches G1 continuity, which means they have the same tangent direction at the boundary.
- Powerful ability to fit large scale point cloud/mesh to a single face. You can handle data with millions of points or polygons and create a single NURBS surface from it.
- Fully automated NURBS surfaces generation. You can let RhinoResurf automatically generate NURBS surfaces from a selected mesh or point cloud with one click.
- Free-form NURBS surface modeling from polygon mesh (.obj mesh). You can model free-form NURBS surfaces from any polygon mesh imported from other software, such as Maya.

RhinoResurf is designed to be user friendly and easy to understand. You can load it manually at the first time and it will automatically load itself into the Rhino environment later. You can access its commands from the Rhino command prompt or from the toolbar.

If you want to learn more about RhinoResurf, you can visit its website at [http://www.resurf3d.com/products.htm](http://www.resurf3d.com/products.htm) where you can find more information, videos, online help, download links and purchase options.
  
If you want to try RhinoResurf for yourself, you can download a free trial version from its website and follow some tutorials that will guide you through the basic steps of reverse engineering. For example, you can learn how to create a solid from a mesh by using RhinoResurf in 6 steps[^1^], or how to handle mesh with RhinoResurf in Rhinoceros for organic forms[^2^]. You can also watch some videos that demonstrate the features and capabilities of RhinoResurf on its website or on YouTube.
 
RhinoResurf is a powerful and easy-to-use plug-in that can help you with reverse engineering and other NURBS modeling tasks. Whether you need to reconstruct the geometry of an object from a scan, create free-form surfaces from polygon meshes, or convert an open or closed mesh to multiple NURBS surfaces[^3^], RhinoResurf can do it for you with high precision and smoothness. RhinoResurf is compatible with RhinocerosÂ® 4.0 and 5.0, and it works on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
