# How to Find Signing Naturally Homework Answers Unit 7 Online
 
Signing Naturally is a popular American Sign Language (ASL) curriculum that teaches students how to communicate effectively and fluently in ASL. The curriculum consists of several units that cover different topics and skills, such as describing people, places, and things, making requests and offers, giving directions, and telling stories.
 
Each unit has a number of homework assignments that require students to practice what they have learned in class and demonstrate their comprehension and proficiency. However, finding the correct answers to these homework assignments can be challenging, especially for beginners who may not have access to a native ASL speaker or instructor.
