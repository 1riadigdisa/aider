If you are a fan of public buses and want to relive the 1980s era of high-floor buses, you will love the OMSI 2 - Addon Citybus O405 O405G. This add-on brings you two versions of the Citybus O405, which was built between 1987 and 2001 and is still in use today thanks to its durability. You can choose between the 12-metre standard variant (O405) and the 18-metre articulated variant (O405G), both featuring realistic 3D models and sounds based on recordings of their real-world counterparts.
  
One of the unique features of this add-on is the dynamic rain feature, which places accumulating rain drops onto the windshield that can actually move. You will also enjoy the custom, highly realistic destination displays and ticket machines, which are created using custom scripts and animations to make sure they behave as lifelike as possible. You can also customize various aspects of the bus, such as doors, ticket machines, and repaints, on the fly without having to reload the bus.
