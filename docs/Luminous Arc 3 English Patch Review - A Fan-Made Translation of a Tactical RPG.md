Unfortunately, Luminous Arc 3 was never officially localized for English-speaking audiences. However, thanks to a dedicated fan translation team, you can now enjoy this game in English with a patch that covers the entire game, including the online mode. In this article, we will show you how to apply the patch and play Luminous Arc 3 in English on your PC or DS.
 
## What You Need
 
- A copy of the original Japanese ROM of Luminous Arc 3. You can find it online or dump it from your own cartridge using a DS flashcart. The CRC-32 of the original ROM should be 848822fd.
- The Luminous Arc 3 English patch v.1.0. You can download it from [this GBAtemp thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-luminous-arc-3-english-patch.605026/) [^1^] or [this GameBrew page](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Luminous_Arc_3_English_Patch) [^2^]. The patch is in xDelta format and has a size of 1.4 MB.
- A tool for applying xDelta patches. You can use xdelta UI, Delta Patcher, or MultiPatch. You can download them from [this RomHacking page](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/) [^1^].
- A DS emulator or a DS flashcart to play the patched ROM. We recommend using DeSmuME or melonDS for PC emulation, or R4i Gold 3DS Plus or DSTWO Plus for DS flashcarts.
- If you want to play online mode, you will need to configure your emulator or flashcart with Wiimmfi Network. You can follow [this guide](https://luminousarc.fandom.com/wiki/Multiplayer) on how to do that.

## How to Apply the Patch

1. Extract the Luminous Arc 3 English patch v.1.0.zip file to a folder on your PC.
2. Open your xDelta patching tool and select the original Japanese ROM as the source file and the Luminous Arc 3 English patch v.1.0.xdelta as the patch file.
3. Choose a name and location for the output file. This will be your patched ROM.
4. Click on Apply Patch and wait for the process to finish.
5. Verify that the CRC-32 of the patched ROM is caec12b5. If not, try patching again with a different tool or a different ROM.
